    "description": "Amazon Cognito Amazon Cognito is a web service that delivers scoped temporary\ncredentials to mobile devices and other untrusted environments. Amazon Cognito\nuniquely identifies a device and supplies the user with a consistent identity\nover the lifetime of an application.\n\nUsing Amazon Cognito, you can enable authentication with one or more third-party\nidentity providers (Facebook, Google, or Login with Amazon), and you can also\nchoose to support unauthenticated access from your app. Cognito delivers a\nunique identifier for each user and acts as an OpenID token provider trusted by\nAWS Security Token Service (STS) to access temporary, limited-privilege AWS\ncredentials.\n\nTo provide end-user credentials, first make an unsigned call to GetId. If the\nend user is authenticated with one of the supported identity providers, set the \nLogins map with the identity provider token. GetId returns a unique identifier\nfor the user.\n\nNext, make an unsigned call to GetCredentialsForIdentity. This call expects the\nsame Logins map as the GetId call, as well as the IdentityID originally returned\nby GetId. Assuming your identity pool has been configured via the \nSetIdentityPoolRoles operation, GetCredentialsForIdentity will return AWS\ncredentials for your use. If your pool has not been configured with \nSetIdentityPoolRoles, or if you want to follow legacy flow, make an unsigned\ncall to GetOpenIdToken, which returns the OpenID token necessary to call STS and\nretrieve AWS credentials. This call expects the same Logins map as the GetId \ncall, as well as the IdentityID originally returned by GetId. The token returned\nby GetOpenIdToken can be passed to the STS operation AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity\n[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity.html] \nto retrieve AWS credentials.\n\nIf you want to use Amazon Cognito in an Android, iOS, or Unity application, you\nwill probably want to make API calls via the AWS Mobile SDK. To learn more, see\nthe AWS Mobile SDK Developer Guide\n[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/mobile/index.html].",
